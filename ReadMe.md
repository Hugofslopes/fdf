FDF
First graphic project in 42
Draw an isometric of an map given

The parsing could be improved if i use one bi-dimensional array instead of an linked list.
This will make the program execute big maps in a fastest way.
There is one other improvement that can me made, that is reading the map for the last 'y' to the first and storing it in this way,
to change the view from the object. 

No bonus made, for now . Its a possible improvement for the future.

make 
./fdf "map_name"
